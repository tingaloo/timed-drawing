## Introduction

This Electron application is a way to do timed drawings on local images.

Right now the app currently defaults to 30 second intervals.

A nice feature would be to add additional class or interval changes.

This will be the most involved since it will involved timeouts and intervals.



## TODO

1. Countdown Timer
2. Warning Timer
3. History Pane
4. Tagging feature? Standing sitting poses.
[x] Add favorites and write to a local file maybe copy favorite files to a favorites folder?
6. If no assets/images is present, display file explorer and prompt for folder path


## Quickstart

```
// Add folders of jpegs within the assets/images folder. The app will glob search all jpeg files and randomly shuffle through them.


npm install
npm start
```
